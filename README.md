This is built as a recretional project to learn more about OAuth and OpenId Connect.

It currently implements most of OAuth 2.1 and a lot of OpenId Connect 1.0. 

It is not a complete implementation, but it is a good starting point for learning about OAuth and OpenId Connect.


Created by spliting out Outback project from https://github.com/Rinsen/InnovationBoost
